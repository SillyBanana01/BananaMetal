       <p><blockquote></blockquote> I love metal, all kinds of metal. Metal concerts are especially fun. I've had the most artist interactions at metal concerts. I believe metalheads are very kind and sensitive. From the people I've met at metal concerts, they were friendly, they use the tone of rage to help them get through tough times. I enjoy the environment, I am also pretty emotional myself. I see metal as a stress reliever as someone would see the gym because of the very upbeat/heavy, dark, and mysterious complexity of the instruments.</p>
